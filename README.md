topics of html

google.com - general searches to look up hex codes, fonts, etc

fontawesome.com - used to implement different icons. It is an icon library and toolki. 

youtube.com - I've looked up several videos to gain inspiration for my own project and problems. I do not have a specific video to point out. I've pulled inspiration from different videos but
ultimately put together my own.
